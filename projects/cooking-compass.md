summary: "My team in a software engineering class developed a web application for UH students to share and discover easy-to-make toaster oven recipes."
---

Cooking Compass is an application that allows UH Mānoa students to share and search for creative recipes that respect the constraints—limited kitchen resources, cooking skills, time—many college-goers face. By providing opportunites to find creative, doable recipes, we aim to foster a community that celebrates resourcefulness, healthy eating, and the joy of cooking.

The project tasks were split amongst the four people who made up our team. We maintained our organization through a combination of GitHub Project, issue driven management, and Google Docs to-do lists.

My tasks included:
* Designing and tidying up the visual aesthetics of various pages, including the homepage, the individual recipe page, the submit recipe page, and so on.
* Programming a dynamic page that read from the database and displayed information about a specific recipe when the user clicked on its associated link in the explore page.
* Setting up the sign-in page, which involved  user authentication.
* Formatting and updating the project homepage as we progressed.
* Creating a user guide to provide users with a thorough walkthrough on navigating the application.
* Incorporating real data to populate the database.
* Distributing the application to real users to test out the app.

Overall, collaborating on Cooking Compass with three other people was a great opportunity to experience working with other people on a real, usable application. Up until this point, most of my endeavors as a Computer Science student had been individual ones, so navigating meeting deadlines, keeping up active communication, and developing quality code that others depend on had been interesting. Sure, I strengthened my skills in intertwining Next.js with PostgreSQL to make a functioning app, but the biggest things I learned had to do with cooperation and team management.
