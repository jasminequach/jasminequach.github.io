## Organization galore!

I’d say I’m sort of an organized person. You know, planners, calendars, to-do lists…

All right, fine. I literally cannot function in chaos. It’s just not in my nature. I wouldn’t call myself a perfectionist, but I definitely like having a sense of control over what’s going on around me; it just makes everything feel more manageable. Of course it’s no surprise that I’ve taken a liking to working with coding standards; going in blind with sloppy code is the bane of my existence. Having clear guidelines for formatting, structure, and naming conventions makes coding way less stressful and a lot more satisfying.

## A helpful, little pest

That being said, I like being organized on my _own_ terms. To be honest, sometimes using ESLint feels a lot like when I was in eighth grade and forced to take Cornell notes instead of notes in the style that actually helped me. (Even now, I am being forced to take Cornell notes—_Cornell_ notes, people! Yuck!—in a different college-level class, but I digress…)

I know how to keep my own workspace orderly. A tool that strictly enforces the guidelines can be helpful, but for someone like me, it can also be a little stifling, especially if it’s just catching tiny, trivial errors like an extra new line at the bottom of my code. Overall, I have mixed feelings. I’m sure I’ll adapt to ESLint pestering me by learning to avoid making those errors in the first place, but for now, it’s almost acting like a real backseat driver!
