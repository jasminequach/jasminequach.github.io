## Patterns here, there, and everywhere!

As we developers build more complex applications, naturally, certain challenges tend to pop up again and again. I suppose we _could_ just do things the hard way, repeatedly writing tedious code from scratch and squashing the same recurring bugs over and over—essentially reinventing the wheel every single time—but why deny what makes life a hundred times easier?

That's where design patterns come in. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Some examples of design patterns include:
* <b>Factory:</b> creates objects without revealing the underlying logic, like the specific class of the object being created.
* <b>Singleton:</b> acts like a global variable by providing one shared object (like a manager) that the whole program can use.
* <b>Observer:</b> defines a one-to-many dependency relationship where a change in one object (the subject) triggers updates in all dependent objects (observers)
* <b>Model-View-Controller (MVC):</b> separates an application into three parts: model (data), view (user interface), and controller (user input)
