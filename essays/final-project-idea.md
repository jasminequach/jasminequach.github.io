## Overview: Problem & Solution

**The problem**: Through web services like [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/), students are able to access reviews to help them gain insight on what to expect from a professor and their courseâ€”but professors have no clear way to gauge the same from their students.

**The solution**: The Rate My Student application allows instructors to read and write reviews on UH students in order to:
* Make preparations to accommodate to incoming students' learning styles
* Leave suggestions on how to best work with past students
* Assess students' qualifications

## Mockup Page Ideas

The Rate My Student application may only be accessed by UH instructors. Once a user profile, verified with a UH email address, is created, the user can search for students by email. If there are no entries made for that student, the user can create a new page, where they may leave a review.

Each review consists of a description of the user's experience with the student, relevant tags, and the student's final grade.

Some possible mockup pages include:
* Landing page
* User home page
* User profile page
* User ratings page
* Student review page

## Use Case Ideas

1.) A professor decides to assess a student's stats in order to decide whether to let them be overridden into a class. The professor arrives at the landing page, logs in, arrives at the home page, searches for and selects the student, and arrives at the page containing all reviews of the student. The reviews provide the professor with the student's capabilities and other professors' impressions of the student.

2.) A professor is trying to improve their teaching style and wants to know how to make their class more engaging for students with different learning styles. The professor arrives at the landing page, logs in, arrives at the home page, searches for and selects their incoming students, and arrives at each page containing all reviews of the student (one at a time). The reviews provide the professor with notes left by other professors, including what kind of learning environments the students work best in.

3.) A professor wants to leave a review for an exceptional student to highlight the student's strengths, character, and potential to other professors. The professor arrives at the landing page, logs in, arrives at the home page, searches for and selects the student, arrives at the page containing all reviews of the student, and creates a new entry. This new review may help professors like the one in the previous scenario.

4.) A professor had a difficult experience teaching a student and wants to share their perspective in order to help the student's future instructors make accommodations. The professor arrives at the landing page, logs in, arrives at the home page, searches for and selects the student, arrives at the page containing all reviews of the student, and creates a new entry. This new review might list the student's strengths and weaknesses, what does and doesn't help the student, and advice on how to work with them.

## Beyond the Basics

Some advanced features could be added after implenting basic functionality:
* The ability for users to "star," "favorite," or "save" individual reviews or student review pages
* The ability to sync up a class roster in order to retrieve reviews quicker
* The ability to reply to other users' reviews
* The ability to recommend students to other users
