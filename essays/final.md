## Mockup Page Ideas

* Similar to Rate My Professor
* Only teachers logging in
* Assume this is only for UH (no need to input what school)
* Can search for student by email ... if no entries, can create new page for that student
* Entries consist of a description (strengths & weaknesses) and relevant tags
* Gives teachers a heads up on students' abilities and personalities ... helps them accomodate
* If a students wants to be overridden into a section, the teacher can look at the student's stats and decide whether they're worthy
* Teachers can add the grade students passed with
* This is only accessed by teachers
