I had just started elementary school when I stepped into a computer lab for the first time—and it was far from the last. Technology has accompanied me all throughout my education. From virtual learning tools like Quizlet and Khan Academy to video conferencing platforms like Zoom and Google Classroom, I have witnessed how software can shape and nurture learning experiences.

My interest in software engineering stems from a deep love for learning, teaching, and creating. I have always found joy in making knowledge accessible, whether through club leadership positions or helping peers better understand challenging concepts, and software development offers the perfect medium to merge my creativity with technology. My goal is to build tools that inspire curiosity and foster growth, just as the technologies I relied on did for me.

I know teamwork is a huge, essential part of software development, so refining my skills in communication and problem-solving in group settings is an inevitable part of the journey. Playing a part in a whole is not unfamiliar to me: I have led clubs, participated in plays, and facilitated school projects. But I know that software development presents its own unique challenges—challenges that excite me because they give me the chance to create things far greater than I could achieve on my own.
