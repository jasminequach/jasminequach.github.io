## Not quite love at first sight...

I mean, sure, I found certain things a bit strange, like the syntax of a function definition line—specifically the syntax of the parameters. I’m used to the way Java and C++ does it: data type then argument name. But TypeScript totally flips the script!

<div class="text-center py-4">
  <img width="500px" class="rounded img-fluid" src="jasminequach.github.io/essays/images/function.png" alt="A silly function definition.">
</div>

Like, what? That goes against everything I’ve ever known! Oh well. We adapt and we learn (and I’m mostly joking anyway).

## The very bright side

What I find the biggest appeal in TypeScript so far is the ability to return multiple data types with one function. That, by the way, also goes against everything I’ve ever known—but, you know, in a good way. The WODs help me appreciate the language. They’re surprisingly kind of fun. I like being challenged to think on the spot.
