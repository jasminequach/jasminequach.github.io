## There are no stupid questions, I promise!

We've all been there—or, well, most of us have. You're sitting in class, listening to your teacher drone on and on and on and... Wait, what did they say? Whatever it was, it did not make a lick of sense. You were paying attention, you swear! You're just confused, and—_uh oh_. It's going to be on the exam? Why is everyone else nodding along like they understand? Like this concept is a piece of cake, carbs and all? Are you really the only fool in sea of geniuses? Obviously, you can't ask for help _now_ or else everybody will think you're a _total_—!

Someone raises their hand. They ask the dreaded question burning in your mind, and you have your answer. (Your eyes fill with happy tears.)

That's pretty much what Stack Overflow is for.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): the website "every programmer has a tab open to." It's a platform meant for sharing technical knowledge by asking questions and sharing answers. On Stack Overflow, you're there to learn, and millions of other people are more than happy to help. You're _not_ a fool in a sea of geniuses! Or, eh, well...

## I broke my promise

Contrary to what they say, it's totally possible to ask a "stupid" question—hey, hey, lower the pitchforks–but it's not needing help that makes someone look "dumb." It's the way they designed their question.

This is an example of a ["bad"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79399913/how-create-api-for-remove-background-application-using-python) question. The user writes:

<div style="background-color: lightgrey; white: white; padding: 10px; word-wrap: break-word;"><code>
How create API for remove background application using python
<br><br>
how to create an API for a remove background application using Python. Need step-by-step guide covers everything from setting up environment to deploying the API, making it easy to build a powerful background removal tool. Perfect for developers and beginners alike!
</code></div>

<b>Now, let's go over where they went wrong:</b>
* Not enough information on the tool they want to create
* Too general: asks for a walkthrough instead of insight on specific challenges
* Essentially, "Can you walk me through every step of my project?"

See what I mean? A question like _that_ earned them nothing but a single downvote.
